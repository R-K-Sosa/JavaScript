In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator.

Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the = operator 
is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.

SOLUTION:

// Setup
var a;
var b = 2;

// Only change code below this line
a = 7;
b = 7;
b = a;
