Best Practice
Write variable names in Javascript in camelCase. 
In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the 
first word in lowercase and the first letter of 
each subsequent word is capitalized.

SOLUTION:

// Declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
