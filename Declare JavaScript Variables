JavaScript provides seven different data types which are:
1) undefined 
2) null
3) boolean 
4) string 
5) symbol 
6) number
7) object

Any of the seven data types may be stored in a variable.

Variables - store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion
Variables - name to represent data we want to refer to
Computer variables differ from mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.

They do this by using a "label" to point to data rather than using data itself.

We tell JavaScript to CREATE or DECLARE a variable by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:

var ourName;

RULES:

1) In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons.

2) Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

SOLUTION:

// Example
var ourName;

// Define myName below this line
var myName;
